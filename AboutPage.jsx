                    undergraduate students who have plenty of first-hand experience spending significant portions of
                    their monthly rent on just a few days’ travel lodging out of their already meager bank accounts.

                    Bo wanted to go on vacation before starting his MBA program. Preparing for the expenses of school,
                    he short because he could not afford to stay longer. He used Turo, a peer-to-peer car-sharing
                    application, to rent a car in Montana.

                    Like most renters, he was prohibited from subleasing, but upon conducting some initial research, he
                    found that he could swap spots with other travelers. He pitched the idea to Gus and Adam who
                    similarly felt constrained by lodging expenses. The trio started Kommu, a lodging swapping platform.
