                    undergraduate students who have plenty of first-hand experience spending significant portions of

                    Bo wanted to go on vacation before starting his MBA program. Preparing for the expenses of school,
                    he short because he could not afford to stay longer. He used Turo, a peer-to-peer car-sharing
                    application, to rent a car in Montana.

                    Like most renters, he was prohibited from subleasing, but upon conducting some initial research, he
                    found that he could swap spots with other travelers. He pitched the idea to Gus and Adam who
                    similarly felt constrained by lodging expenses. The trio started Kommu, a lodging swapping platform.
